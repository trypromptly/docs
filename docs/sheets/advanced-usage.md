Promptly Sheets offer powerful capabilities for advanced users. Here are some tips and techniques to take your sheet workflows to the next level.

## Chaining Operations

You can create complex workflows by chaining operations across multiple columns. For example:

1. Column A: Input text
2. Column B: Processor_run to summarize the text
3. Column C: App_run to analyze sentiment of the summary
4. Column D: Data_transformer to create a final report

This chain allows you to process data through multiple steps automatically.

A processor is the smallest building block in Promptly. It is a function that takes some input, does something with it, and returns some output. Each processor defines its own input, configuration, and output schemas. You can quickly test processors in the Processor Playground at [http://localhost:3000/playground](http://localhost:3000/playground).
